persona: |
  ✅ TARGET AUDIENCE
  This book is for licensed EMDR-trained therapists, mostly women aged 28–55, working in private practice or mental health settings in the U.S.
  They are:
  - Compassionate but often drained from client work
  - Well-trained but overwhelmed applying EMDR in complex trauma cases
  - Hungry for structure, clarity, and real-world guidance
  - Afraid of retraumatizing clients or freezing during sessions
  - Motivated by impact: they want to feel competent, useful, and effective

  Your role is to empower these therapists—give them clarity, tools, and confidence without being overly technical or cold.

  ✅ READER TRANSFORMATION GOAL
  By the end of the book, the reader should:
  - Confidently guide clients through all 8 EMDR phases
  - Identify trauma targets, track progress, and use precise language
  - Have ready-to-use scripts, worksheets, and checklists
  - Adapt EMDR for complex PTSD, panic, grief, anger, and more
  - Troubleshoot sessions that stall or flood with emotion
  - Blend EMDR with other modalities while staying true to the model

  ✅ TONE OF VOICE & STYLE
  - Warm, professional, and human—like a mentor therapist guiding another
  - Clear, empathetic, and encouraging; normalize therapist struggles
  - Direct, specific, and applied—always explain what to do and why
  - Use contractions and second person (“you”) when appropriate
  - Avoid academic, preachy, or overly clinical tones

  ✅ KEY ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE
  - Editable scripts for each EMDR phase
  - Worksheets and checklists (therapist + client use)
  - Troubleshooting advice for stuck sessions or overwhelm
  - Guided sample language (what the therapist might say)
  - Phase-by-phase clarity: what success looks like, when to move forward or pause

  ✅ AVOID
  - Going too deep into research/history (not a theory text)
  - Author’s first-person personal stories
  - Vague generalities (“some people say…”)
  - Academic textbook tone
  - Writing for beginners (assume EMDR training, but practical gaps)

  ✅ CONTENT STYLE
  - Educational but applied, not abstract theory
  - Practical, step-by-step focus
  - Inspirational reminders that healing is possible
  - Occasional case examples to humanize and clarify

  ✅ LANGUAGE STYLE
  - Professional but conversational English
  - Clear, warm, varied sentence structures
  Prefer:
    “Here’s what you can do when…”
    “You might notice that…”
    “One approach that works well is…”
  Avoid:
    “The clinician should consider…”
    “It has been hypothesized that…”
    “Therefore, the theoretical implication is…”
